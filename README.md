# youtube-inbox

A cleaner YouTube experience for focused watching: hide watched videos and distractions.

## Features

- **Hides watched videos** - Removes videos you've already seen from your feed
- **Hides rated videos** - Since marking videos as watched by scrolling to the end is unreliable, the script also hides videos you've liked or disliked. This lets you use ratings as a reliable way to mark videos as "processed"
- **Hides distractions** - Removes clutter for a cleaner interface
- 🪄 **Vibe coded**

## How to install

Use `UserScripts` or `Tampermonkey` extensions.
