# youtube-inbox

A cleaner YouTube experience for focused watching.

The script does 2 things: 
- Hides distractions (`declutter.js`) 
- Hides watched videos (`hide-watched-videos.js`). When YouTube watch history is enabled, fully watched videos are marked with a red progress bar. However, if you watched a video a long time ago, YouTube may no longer display it as watched — there's no reliable long-term "watched" indicator. To work around this, the script also hides liked/disliked videos, letting you use ratings as a permanent "watched" marker.

🪄 Vibe coded.

## How to install

Use `UserScripts` or `Tampermonkey` extensions.
