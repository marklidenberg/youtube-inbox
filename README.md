A cleaner YouTube experience for focused watching.

## Scripts 
- `declutter.js`: hides distractions. Customizable
- `hide-watched-videos.js`: hides watched videos. When YouTube watch history is enabled, fully watched videos are marked with a red progress bar. But if you watched a video on another account, cleared your history, or had history disabled — there's no way to mark it as fully watched quickly (the YouTube API doesn't support marking videos as watched). To work around this, the script also hides liked/disliked videos, letting you use ratings as a permanent "watched" marker.

🪄 Vibe coded.

## How to install

Use `UserScripts` or `Tampermonkey` extensions.
