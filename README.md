A cleaner YouTube experience for focused watching: hide watched videos and distractions.

Since marking videos as watched by scrolling to the end is unreliable, the script also hides liked/disliked videos — letting you use ratings as a reliable way to mark videos as "watched".

## How to install

Use `UserScripts` or `Tampermonkey` extensions.
