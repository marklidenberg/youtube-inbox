# youtube-inbox

A cleaner YouTube experience for focused watching: hide distractions and already-watched videos.

The whole project is vibe coded. 

## How to install 

Use `UserScripts` or `Tampermonkey` extensions.

## Issues

- YouTube doesn't mark videos as watched even when scrolled to the end. No method found to mark videos as watched directly from the thumbnail view, which significantly limits usability.
