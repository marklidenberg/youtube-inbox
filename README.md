# youtube-inbox

A cleaner YouTube experience for focused watching.

The script does 2 things: 
- Hides distractions (`declutter.js`) 
- Hides watched videos (`hide-watched-videos.js`). Since there's no reliable way to mark videos as fully watched, the script also hides liked/disliked videos — letting you use ratings as a "watched" marker.

🪄 Vibe coded.

## How to install

Use `UserScripts` or `Tampermonkey` extensions.
