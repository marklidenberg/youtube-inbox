# youtube-inbox

A cleaner YouTube experience for focused watching: hide watched videos and distractions.

Since there is no reliable and simple way to mark videos as "watched till the end", the script also hides liked/disliked videos — letting you use ratings as a reliable way to mark videos as "watched". 

🪄 **Vibe coded**.

## How to install

Use `UserScripts` or `Tampermonkey` extensions.
