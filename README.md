# youtube-inbox

A cleaner YouTube experience for focused watching: hide watched videos and distractions.

Since there's no reliable way to mark videos as fully watched, the script hides liked/disliked videos—letting you use ratings as a "watched" marker. 

🪄 **Vibe coded**.

## How to install

Use `UserScripts` or `Tampermonkey` extensions.
