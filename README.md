# youtube-inbox

A cleaner YouTube experience for focused watching: hide watched videos and distractions.

## Features

- **Hides watched videos** - Removes videos you've already seen from your feed. Since marking videos as watched by scrolling to the end is unreliable, the script also hides liked/disliked videos — letting you use ratings as a reliable way to mark videos as "watched"
- **Hides distractions** - Removes clutter for a cleaner interface
- 🪄 **Vibe coded**

## How to install

Use `UserScripts` or `Tampermonkey` extensions.
